# Challenge:
Find 3 more classifiers from the sci-kit learn documentation and add them to the code. Train them on the same dataset and compare their results. 
The following classifiers were chosen:

• Decision Tree Classifier

• Nearest Neighbour Classifier 

• Random Forest Classifier

• Naive Bayes Classifier

# Usage:
just run
 python classifier.py

# Status:
    • DecisionTreeClassifier    Accuracy:  90.98%
    • KNeighborsClassifier      Accuracy:  87.27%
    • RandomForestClassifier    Accuracy:  90.72%
    • GaussianNB             	Accuracy:  84.88%
